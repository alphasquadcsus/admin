Important:
	
	After uploading images with the admin site, 
		since the admin site and mobile application folders are seperate,
		it is necessary to copy the image files from public/img to the img 
		folder in the mobile application folder
		
		
Note:

	Since the app and admin packages will be seperate, it might be better
	to simply upload images as urls instead of local uploads.
